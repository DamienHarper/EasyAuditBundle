Override Default Logger
========================

You can also override default logger service. You could easily customize Logger with a version adapted to your needs. Then define it as a service (say my.own.logger.service).

To use the my.own.logger.service as logger set the following configuration


``` yaml
xiidea_easy_audit:
    #logger: my.own.logger.service

```
